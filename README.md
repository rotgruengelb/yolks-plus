# Yolks-Plus

Modified Versions of [pelican-eggs/yolks](https://github.com/pelican-eggs/yolks) to include extra dependencies, tools, etc.

A curated collection of core images that can be used with Pterodactyl's Egg system. Each image is rebuilt
periodically to ensure dependencies are always up-to-date.

Images are hosted on `ghcr.io`.

All of these images are available for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` versions, unless otherwise specified, to use
these images on an arm system, no modification to them or the tag is needed, they should just work.
